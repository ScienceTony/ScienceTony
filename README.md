## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my degree in Computing and IT.  

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Computing and IT at the Open University. 
- I am also learning Cobol in my spare time. 

## ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a projects centered around cancer research.

## ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for a career in cancer research and hold a special interest in cancer awareness especially for colorectal cancer.  
Ideally, I would like a cure for all cancer, which leads me to computer science since the protein folding problem. incidentally, this is solved with the same algorithm that solves a sudoku problem.  However, this is an NP Hard problem meaning that it is too slow and current algorithms would need more time than we have left before the universe is predicted to end.
