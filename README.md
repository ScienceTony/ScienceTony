## ðŸ”­ ðŸ§  Iâ€™m currently working on 
### My degree in Computing and IT.
I have been at the Open University for 6 years and in that time I have leaned about different aspects of computing from sofeware engernering to analysing data with python and SQL. At the moment I am looking at my final project, which could be an app of some sort for an Andriod phone. 

## ðŸŒ± ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™m currently learning
### Computing and IT at the Open University
- Computer science route
- Covers both client side and server side
### I am also learning Cobol in my spare time. 
- I make YouTube video tutorials to help others

## ðŸ‘¯ ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate 
### Projects centered around cancer research
- Data analysis
- Websites

### Databases
- SQL
- Python
- MongoDB

## ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for 
### A career in cancer research
- I hold a special interest in cancer awareness especially for colorectal cancer.  
- Ideally, I would like a cure for all cancer, which leads me to computer science since the protein folding problem. incidentally, this is solved with the same algorithm that solves a sudoku problem.  However, this is an NP Hard problem meaning that it is too slow and current algorithms would need more time than we have left before the universe is predicted to end.
